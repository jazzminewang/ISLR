1. The null hypothesis is a logical "Not". In this case, the null hypothesis for each variable is that it has no effect.
eg. the null hypothesis for "TV" is that in the presence of radio ads and newspaper ads, TV ads have no effect on sales. 
The low p-values for TV and radio mean that they are statistially significant, and therefore that the null hypothesis is false for those variables.
The high p-value for newspaper means that it is not statistically significant, and therefore that the null hypothesis holds true. 


2. 
The KNN classifier and KNN regression formulae are closely related - the classifier produces a qualitative output (classification), whereas the regression predicts a quantitative value. 

3. 
Y = 50 + 20(gpa) + 0.07(iq) + 35(gender) + 0.01(gpa * iq) - 10 (gpa * gender)
a) iii.
b) female w/ IQ of 110 and GPA 4.0 = 137.1
c) False. statistical significance is shown through p-value of the coefficient, not with the value of the coefficient itself.
